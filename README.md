# Regression model for Ordinal Compositional Data using Wasserstein distance.

This is the code we used for the simulation study in the paper "Regression models for ordinal compositional data". 
The code in this version is available for case stydy reproducibility purposes only. 

## Usage

To run the simulations launch the .R files for each case (I, II, III, IV), which recalls the Functions_simplex.R file. Be sure to have installed the packages referred to in Functions_simplex.R.
